Implemented the find ,find and replace feature in text editor using Boyre-Moore algorithm

Got the base code from https://github.com/rasppie/Text_Editor/blob/master/texteditor.py and added the find ,find and replace feature
 to it.
 
 Boyer–Moore string search algorithm is an efficient string searching algorithm that is the standard benchmark for practical string search literature.
Preprocessing time: Θ(m + k)	
 Matching time: best Ω(n/m), worst O(n)
